# :star2:Marketplace-project

This project is my first django python framework project, which was created by reworking many other projects. The project is a marketplace bulletin board and is still far from perfect.Hosting was not implemented on the project due to uselessness
The project was made dynamically with a parallel study of the django framework from the YouTube channel [Selfedu YT](https://www.youtube.com/@selfedu_rus/featured)▶️

**The project was made with:**

✔️ Framework Django (Python)

✔️ HTML&CSS

✔️ Javascript

✔️ ~~My tears~~


## What are the possibilities of the Market?

1️⃣   There is registration and authorization  :frowning_man:

2️⃣   Shopping cart for adding products, which is available upon authorization  :wastebasket:

3️⃣   Products are divided into categories :clipboard: 

4️⃣   Add item function, which is available upon authorization  :heavy_multiplication_x:
  
5️⃣   Product search function :telescope:

The project itself took me one or two days, but learning Django took a little longer.
